# Project: Logs Analyses

This repo is part of a series of projects belonging to my [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). Purpose of this lesson is to dig deeper into SQL language using a python script. The script facilitates the [psycopg2 adapter](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/) to connect to a database filled with mock data. You can find the database schema [here](/docs/db-schema.md). For more info on how analysis is done and which questions it answers check section [Usage](#usage).

## Installation

The project uses [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1) and [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) as development environment. For more info on setup look into the [VM configuration](/Vagrantfile). To get the VM up and running you need to have both tools (vortualbox and vagrant) installed on your computer. 

1.  `git clone git@github.com:tderleth/1-logs-analysis.git`
2.  `cd 1-logs-analysis`
3.  `vagrant up && vagrant ssh`
4.  Within the VM run `sudo pip install termcolor` (adds a package to easily highlight shell output)

## Import data

In order to use the tool you need to import the data into the VM database. Unzip the [data file](/newsdata.sql.zip) and run `psql -d news -f newsdata.sql` inside your vagrant machine. 

## <a name="usage">Usage</a>

After performing all previous steps you can interact with the analysis tool. You have the following options (first make sure that your pwd is `/vagrant`):

-   `python logs.py articles` - What are the three most popular three articles of all time?
-   `python logs.py authors` - Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
-   `python logs.py errors` - On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?
-   `python logs.py all` - Dumps all statistics to all above listed methods
